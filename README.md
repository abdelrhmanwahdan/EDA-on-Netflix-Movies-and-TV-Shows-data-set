![Netflix](images/netflix.jpg "Netflix")

Who doesn’t like Netflix? This dataset on kaggle has tv shows and movies available on Netflix. One can create a good quality Exploratory Data Analysis project using this dataset. Using this dataset, one can find out: what type of content is produced in which country, identify similar content from the description, and much more interesting tasks.  
So in this project I am doing exploratory data analysis (data cleaning , data proceccing , data visualizations) on this dataset.
